Nimble Coding Challenge

Instructions: Please host your code on Github and share the repo link (via email to me). Do as much as you can in 2-3 hours. The attached zip file contains an example image and a json file.

Implement a combination of ReactJS components to create a page with a list of candidates using the data found in data.json. You can see a similar example in candidates.png.

When the user clicks a row, it should bring up a modal/overlay that shows all of the candidate information.

If you still have time left, implement sorting or some way to filter the list of candidates.
